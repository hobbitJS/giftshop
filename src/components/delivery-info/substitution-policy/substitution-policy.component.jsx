    <p>
      Substitutions may be necessary from time to time to ensure your
      arrangement is delivered in a timely manner. When this happens, the utmost
      care and attention is given to your order to ensure that substitutions
      yield a similarly delightful delivery of equal or greater value. Here is
      more information about how we approach substitutions:
    </p>
    <b>Flowers</b>
    <p>
      In arrangements of assorted flowers, we will focus first on replicating
      the look and feel as well as the color palette of what was ordered, even
      if it means substituting other kinds of flowers of equal or greater value.
      For one-of-a kind flower arrangements, such as an all roses or all lilies
      bouquet, we will make every attempt to match the flower type, but may have
      to substitute with another color. If the floral container shown online is
      not available, a similar container may be used.
    </p>
    <b>Plants</b>
    <p>
      For green or blooming plants, similar plants may be substituted, always of
      equal or greater value. For one of a kind plants, such as orchids, we will
      make every effort to match plant type, but may have to substitute with
      another color. If the plant container shown online is not available, a
      similar container will be used.
