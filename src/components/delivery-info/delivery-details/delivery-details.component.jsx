        more than 150 countries across the globe. To place an international
        order, or for more specific information on the 150 countries we serve,
        please visit our International Shop. Unfortunately, we cannot guarantee
        delivery at a specific time of day. Substitution may be necessary to
        ensure your gift is delivered on the day you requested. Taxes are based
        on prevailing rates in the delivery area. In most areas of the United
        States and Canada, orders placed as late as 2p.m. in the recipient's
        time zone can be delivered that day (earlier times may apply to some
        areas and during holidays). Saturday and Sunday deliveries are available
        in some areas for orders placed by 1p.m. in the recipient's time zone.
